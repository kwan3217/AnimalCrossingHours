This folder contains the hourly songs, named hh.flac where hh is 
the local time hour to play this song, from 00-23. On my system
they are symlinks to the actual data.

* data/clear - pointers to the soundtrack files with no tag, played
  during sunny days and clear nights
* data/rainy - pointers to the soundtrack files with the tag "Rainy",
  played during rain
* data/snowy - Pointers to the soundtrack files with the tag "Snowy",
  played in winter
* data/chimes - I actually made this one myself, so it's checked in. It's
  the default island tune, slightly modified. `Meekay I Chimes.it`
  is an InfoTracker mod file (I think I used CheeseTracker to make it)
  and `Meekay I Chimes.ogg` is that file rendered into ogg.
